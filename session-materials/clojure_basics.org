* What is Clojure
  
- Free & Open Source: Eclipse Public License v 1.0

- General Purpose (anything you can do in Java)

- Dynamic Types

- Functional Pragmatic not Dogmatic

- Compiled yet dynamic
  - All Clojure features are supported at runtime

- Dialect of LISP
  - homoiconic - "code as data"

  - macros - "programs writing programs"

  - almost no syntax

** Homoiconic - Programs Writing Programs
   
#+attr_org: :width 250
[[./images/300px-DrawingHands.jpg]]
   
A language is homoiconic if a program written in it can be manipulated as 
data using the language, and thus the program's internal representation can
be inferred just by reading the program itself.

#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (def data (list reduce + [1 2 3 2]))

  (eval data)

#+end_src


* Getting Clojure

** Leiningen 
   
[[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] is 'the easiest way' to use Clojure.

Like Apache Maven, it has declarative builds and declarative dependencies
defined in a *project.clj* file at the root of your project.

Profiles are also supported through a *profile.clj* file for things like
repo locations and credentials.

** Clojure CLI

The current recommended way to run Clojure is with the [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started][Clojure CLI tool]].

The CLI tool only does declarative dependencies and runs Clojure apps or
the Clojure REPL.

Builds can be integrated into the Clojure CLI which is generally encouraged to 
be imperative through Clojure code, Bash scripts, etc.

** Building Clojure from Source
   
*Clojure is Java*

The [[https://github.com/clojure/clojure][Clojure Github repository]] contains everything you need to build and 
run from source using only Apache Maven.

*** To build a stand-alone jar with dependencies included
1. git clone https://github.com/clojure/clojure
2. mvn -Plocal -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
3. java -jar clojure.jar

The 'uberjar' built just includes the Clojure jar and an additional 
library, 'spec-alpha'.

Typically running Clojure (like Lein would do behind the scenes) is just 
about building a classpath; just like any other Java app.

*** To use the stand-alone jar:
    
Run 'java -jar clojure.jar' with following options

+ '-e' to eval a string
+ '-m my-app.core' to call the -main function from a namespace

Demo:

java -Dclojure.server.repl='{:port 5455 :accept clojure.core.server/repl}' \
     -jar clojure.jar \
     -e '(def greeting "hello world") 
         (while true 
           (println greeting)
           (Thread/sleep 3000))'

*** Example classpath for running Clojure:
~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.10.1/clojure-1.10.1.jar:
~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/spec.alpha/0.2.176/spec.alpha-0.2.176.jar:
~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/core.specs.alpha/0.2.44/core.specs.alpha-0.2.44.jar

java -cp $classpath 
     clojure.main -m my-app.core
     

     
* Data Types
  
** Strings

Enclosed in "double quotes". May span multiple lines. 

Standard Java escape characters are supported.


** Numbers

Generally represented as per Java

Integers can be indefinitely long and will be read as Longs when in range and 
clojure.lang.BigInts otherwise. 

Integers with an N suffix are always read as BigInts.

Octal notation is allowed with a 0 prefix, and hexadecimal notation is allowed
with a 0x prefix. When possible, they can be specified in any base with radix 
from 2 to 36 (see Long.parseLong()); for example 2r101010, 052, 8r52, 0x2a,
36r16, and 42 are all the same Long.

Floating point numbers are read as Doubles; with M suffix they are read as 
BigDecimals.

Ratios are supported, e.g. 22/7.

*** Infinite precision!

#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (/ 2 7)

#+end_src

*** Numbers are classes

#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (class 42)

#+end_src


** Characters 

Preceded by a backslash: \c. \newline, \space, \tab, \formfeed, \backspace, 
and \return yield the corresponding characters. 

Unicode characters are represented with \uNNNN as in Java.

Octals are represented with \oNNN.


** Booleans

true and false
  

** nil

nil is a possible value of any data type in Clojure and can be returned by any
function call in Clojure or Java and is the return value of a Java 'void' method.

nil has the same value as Java null.

The Clojure conditional system is based around nil and false, with nil and false
representing the values of logical falsity in conditional tests - anything 
else is logical truth. 

In addition, nil is used as the end-of-sequence sentinel value 
in the sequence protocol.

nil is pervasive in Clojure, unlike in Java where nil is anomalous and must
be guarded against by checks. 

*** nil is used to represent 'empty' lists
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
  (str 
     "conj empty list: "
     (conj '() 1)

     " , conj nil: "
     (conj nil 1)
  )

#+end_src

*** nil is falsey
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(or nil "nil is falsey")
#+end_src

*** nil != 0
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(+ 1 nil)
#+end_src

*** nil is an empty string "", sometimes
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(str nil "works!" nil)
#+end_src

*** nil is not an empty string most of the time
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(clojure.string/upper-case nil)
#+end_src


** :keyword

Keywords are symbolic identifiers that evaluate to themselves

They provide very fast equality tests

Like Symbols, they have names and optional namespaces, both of which are strings

The leading ':' is not part of the namespace or name

Keywords implement IFn for invoke() of one argument (a map) with an optional 
second argument (a default value).

For example ~(:mykey my-hash-map :none)~ means the same as 
~(get my-hash-map :mykey :none)~

*** Is it a function?

#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (:hello {:a 1 :b 2} 42)

#+end_src




     
* Data Structures
  
** List

Lists are the simplest collection. They are 'linked lists'
that append items to the head, like a stack.
  
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(conj (list 1 2) 3)
#+end_src

Lists are the main building blocks of Clojure apps. The Clojure 'reader'
will try to execute the first symbol or value in a list as a function. To use a
list as just a data structure, it needs to be 'quoted.

*** List literal
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(conj '(1 2) 3)
#+end_src

*** Is it a function?
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(eval (conj '(41) inc))
#+end_src

This is an example of the homoiconic property of LISPs like Clojure. 

The code is represented in data structures; i.e. "code is data"


** Vector
   
A Vector is a collection of values indexed by contiguous integers.

Vectors support access to items by index in log32N hops.

count is O(1).


*** Is it a function?
    
#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  ([4 5 6 7] 2)

#+end_src
  
A vector is an associative data structure, like a map, where values assocate 
with indices.


** Map

A Map is a collection that maps keys to values.

Hash maps require keys that correctly support hashCode and equals.

Hash maps provide access (log32N hops).

count is O(1)

*** Is it a function?
#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  ({:a 1 :b 2} :b)

#+end_src


** Set
   
A set is a collection of unique values.

Supports literal creation:

#+begin_src clojure :results pp
#{:a :b :c}
#+end_src

Literal creation is the same as:

#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(hash-set :a :b :c)
#+end_src

Can create sorted sets:

#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(sorted-set :c :b :a)
#+end_src

*** Is it a function?

#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(#{:a :b :c} :b)
#+end_src


** Seq
   
Clojure defines many algorithms in terms of sequences (seqs). 
A seq is a logical list. Clojure uses the ISeq interface to allow many 
data structures to provide access to their elements as sequences. 
   
*** The Seq Interface

~(first coll)~
Returns the first item in the collection.
 Calls seq on its argument. If coll is nil, returns nil.

~(rest coll)~
Returns a sequence of the items after the first.
 Calls seq on its argument. If there are no more items,
 returns a logical sequence for which seq returns nil.

~(cons item seq)~
Returns a new seq where item is the first element and seq is the rest.

*** Examples

Seq on a Vector?
#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (first [1 2 3])

#+end_src

Seq on a Map?
#+begin_src clojure :results pp

  (first {:a 1 :b 2})

#+end_src

Seq is often used to see if list is 'exhausted'
#+begin_src clojure :results pp
  (seq [1 2])

  (seq [])

  (seq nil)
#+end_src



* EDN (Extensible Data Notation)
  
[[https://github.com/edn-format/edn][EDN Specification]]

EDN is an extensible data notation. A superset of edn is used by Clojure to 
represent programs, and it is used by Datomic and other applications as a 
data transfer format.

EDN data is serializable and represents values. There are standard data types 
such as string, integers, maps, vectors, etc. 

#+begin_src clojure :results pp
  (def data (clojure.edn/read-string "{:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}"))

  (:b data)
#+end_src

** Extensibility with Tags

EDN is also extensible. A # followed by an alphabetical character represents a
'tag'. Tags always apply to the next value after the tag. Tags only apply to one
value. Tags are meant to be handled by a custom reader that would read the tag
and the succeeding value.

For example, the Nomad library utilizes tags in edn files to signal that the 
next value is an environment variable.


#+begin_src clojure :results pp
  ;; given this EDN data structer 
  {:username #nomad/env-var "DATABASE_USER"}

  ;; the nomad reader produces this Clojure map
  {:username "contoso"}

  ;; given 'export DATABASE_USER=contoso'
#+end_src
